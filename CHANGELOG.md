# Changelog

All notable changes to Tamakkun are documented here. Versions follow the roadmap in `docs/decisions.md`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- README: cover image, highlights with content numbers, and a screenshot gallery (`screenshots/`, WebP).
- Public navbar on every public page (الرئيسية، المحتوى، لوحة الشرف، عن المنصة، مصادر رسمية), with a phone menu.
- Public content catalogue (`/content`): visitors browse every section, category, chapter and lesson title. Opening a lesson, game, test or file requires an account; no video or external URL is sent to guests.
- «لوحة الشرف» (`/leaderboard`): top students this month and all time (first name and family initial only), with an admin switch.
- Footer credit «تمكّن © 2026 · تطوير Mansoour» (links to mansoour.com; the year becomes a range automatically) on every page; LICENSE file and copyright notices (© 2026 Mansoour, mansoour.com) in the code, README, composer.json, package.json and page metadata.
- New, higher-quality site graphics, app icons and favicon; the link-preview image is now `og-image.jpg` (79 KB).
- Site graphics from docs/graphics.md: 8 illustrations (home page, learning paths, steps, counselor, supervision, login/register panel), the link-preview image, and new app icons and favicon.
- «تأسيس أينشتاين»: a 61-video foundation course for القدرات الكمي (YouTube playlist), in its own category at the top of the section, in lecture order, with the new source «أينشتاين». See the source caveat in docs/content-sources.md.
- «تجميعات المنصف 1500 سؤال» (free PDF) at the top of القدرات الكمي ← مراجع وتجميعات, source المنصف.
- 20 real «تحدي اليوم» challenges (60 questions with explanations: كمي، لفظي، تحصيلي), scheduled one per day from the day the migration runs, and 16 real «دفعة اليوم» motivation items.
- Twelve free القدرات sample tests (Google Forms), each in the category it tests, including a placement test for each section. The listing store is not recorded as a source.
- Privacy warning on every external link (content «فتح المصدر», «روابط مهمة», public resources): do not enter real personal details; use a dummy phone number such as 0500000000 if one is required.
- Student self-registration at `/register`: name, username, optional email, password, and school → grade → classroom chosen from linked lists (active schools, current academic year). New setting «تسجيل الطالبات»: open (active at once), approval (an admin activates) or closed. A school with a single counselor gets new students assigned to her.
- New home page: hero with the supervision badge, live content numbers, the three learning paths, «كيف تبدئين؟» steps, features, a counselor section, a supervision card and a call to action. Open Graph tags for link previews.
- Settings «اسم المشرفة» and «صفة الإشراف» (default: إشراف وإدارة المنصة: أ. فاطمة الشهراني), shown on the home page, login and register pages and the footer.
- `<x-illustration>` and `docs/graphics.md`: every site graphic with its file name, size, palette and prompt. A graphic appears as soon as its file is added under `public/images/`.
- Real القدرات content (الكمي واللفظي) from the team's Google Site «العب وتدرب قدرات وتحصيلي»: 258 published items (90 YouTube videos, 139 games and e-tests on Wordwall, Quizalize and Google/Microsoft Forms, 29 Google Drive files). Each item is placed in the category it is about and keeps the site's order. Rows live in `database/data/qudurat-content.php` and are imported by migration `2026_10_13_000001_import_qudurat_content` (idempotent; admin edits are never overwritten).
- New categories: كمي «استراتيجيات الحل», «أسئلة المقارنة», «نماذج وتجميعات محلولة», «اختبارات شاملة ومحاكية», «مراجع وتجميعات»; لفظي «المفردة الشاذة», «اختبارات شاملة ومحاكية», «مراجع وتجميعات». New source «منصة العب وتدرب قدرات وتحصيلي».
- Real التحصيلي – الرياضيات content from the same site: 501 published items (249 YouTube videos, 232 games, activities and e-tests, 20 Google Drive files) in 29 chapters and 174 topics. The 24 curriculum chapters (أول، ثاني، ثالث ثانوي) each hold the matching «دورة فن التحصيلي» lessons, every lesson's game with its solution video and, for ثالث ثانوي, the chapter e-test; then تجميعات 1447هـ, تجميعات 1446هـ, the comprehensive e-tests, مبادرة جسم and مراجع وتجميعات. Rows live in `database/data/tahsili-math-content.php`, imported by migration `2026_10_14_000001_import_tahsili_math_content`.

### Changed
- Student sign-up requires an email address. No verification email is sent and the account is still active at once.
- Student menu: «موعدي ودرجتي» moved to second place, right after «الرئيسية», followed by «دفعة اليوم»، «تقدمي» and «الإشعارات».
- Fonts: headings and display text use Alexandria 700/800 (page titles 800); body and UI text use IBM Plex Sans Arabic 400/500/700. Only these weights are loaded; `font-semibold` (600) is no longer used. Emails list IBM Plex Sans Arabic first, where the reader's device has it.

### Fixed
- Dropdown arrows sit at the far left of every select field (RTL), instead of on the right where the text starts.
- Every form field is now right-to-left (usernames, email, URLs, phone numbers and passwords used to be forced left-to-right).
- The page scrollbar is on the left, as on an Arabic site, on desktop and laptop screens: the body is the scroll container, so it follows `dir="rtl"`. Touch devices keep normal page scrolling.

### Removed
- Fake demo lessons, the demo Tahsili lesson and the demo quiz from `DemoSeeder`.
- Every «تجريبي» demo record: `DemoSeeder` now creates only an admin, one counselor and one student (no labels, realistic notes and a welcome announcement) in «مدرسة تمكّن الثانوية», with grades 1–3 so self-registration can be tried locally. The fake challenge and motivations were replaced by the real ones.

## [v0.9.0] — 2026-10-12 — Completion and polish

### Added
- Full settings screen: platform name and tagline, default target score, alert thresholds (inactivity days, upcoming-exam days, low-activity threshold), support email and phone, About/Privacy/Terms text and external links. The name and tagline now appear in the brand, page titles, public pages and emails.
- Public pages `/about`, `/resources`, `/privacy`, `/terms` on a shared public layout. Unwritten legal pages show «قريبًا» and are not linked until they have content. `/resources` lists only admin-verified official links and source websites.
- Roles and permissions screen (`/admin/roles`, new `roles.manage` permission): edit each role's permissions, audited, with self-lockout protection.
- Read-only "view as user" for admins (new `users.view-as` permission): banner, GET-only, every viewed request rolled back, audited.
- Quiz engine (brief §54): multiple-choice and true/false questions on «اختبار قصير» content, pass percentage, instant score with explanations, unlimited retakes. Passing completes the content; counselors see results on the student page. A demo quiz is added to the local demo seeder.
- `php artisan tamakkun:doctor` (environment check) and `php artisan tamakkun:create-admin` (first admin without tinker).
- Windows/XAMPP setup guide (`docs/windows-setup.md`).
- Installable site: web app manifest, home-screen icons and Apple touch icon (no service worker, no offline mode).

### Changed
- Student sign-up requires an email address. No verification email is sent and the account is still active at once.
- Student menu: «موعدي ودرجتي» moved to second place, right after «الرئيسية», followed by «دفعة اليوم»، «تقدمي» and «الإشعارات».
- `SettingsService` reads are memoised per request; the service is `scoped` so queue workers read fresh values for each job.
- Accessibility fixes from an axe-core audit of 40 pages at 375px and 1280px: score card heading level, the desktop notification bell inside a landmark, contrast of unearned badges, keyboard-scrollable tables. Quiz answers with numbers render in the correct direction.

### Fixed
- Dropdown arrows sit at the far left of every select field (RTL), instead of on the right where the text starts.
- CI: the production-cache step now uses the file cache store, because `optimize:clear` flushed the database cache and CI has no MySQL server.

### Removed
- Laravel's placeholder `ExampleTest` (the home page is covered by `LayoutTest`).

## [v0.8.0] — 2026-10-11 — Reports, email and hardening

### Added
- 10 reports (student progress, class progress, Qudurat scores, Tahsili scores, improvement, upcoming exams, not booked, inactive, content completion, challenge participation) for counselors (own students) and admins (all). On-screen view, CSV (UTF-8 BOM) and Arabic RTL PDF via mPDF, with the bundled IBM Plex Sans Arabic font (OFL). Exports are audited.
- Email: notifications also go by email to users with an address (admin switch **إرسال الإشعارات بالبريد أيضًا**), using the RTL `<x-mail.layout>`. The Arabic password-reset email is now queued. Failed queued emails are logged as `failed`.
- Admin viewers for the audit log (with filters) and the email log.
- Permissions `reports.view`, `audit-logs.view` and `email-logs.view` (migration).
- CI: production cache check (`php artisan optimize`), `composer audit` and `npm audit --omit=dev`.
- Docs: `docs/reports.md`, plus updates to email, security (review table), backups (verified run), deployment, permissions, architecture, testing and decisions.

### Fixed
- Dropdown arrows sit at the far left of every select field (RTL), instead of on the right where the text starts.
- Open redirect: notification links are now followed only for this exact host.
- CSV exports neutralise spreadsheet formula injection.

### Changed
- Student sign-up requires an email address. No verification email is sent and the account is still active at once.
- Student menu: «موعدي ودرجتي» moved to second place, right after «الرئيسية», followed by «دفعة اليوم»، «تقدمي» and «الإشعارات».
- Every navigation section is now built, so no "قريبًا" placeholders remain.

## [v0.7.0] — 2026-10-10 — Challenge, motivation, announcements, notifications

### Added
- تحدي اليوم: daily multiple-choice or true/false questions, one attempt, instant feedback with explanation and streak, history, admin authoring (locked once answered), counselor challenges tab.

## [v0.6.0] — 2026-10-09 — Counselor dashboard

### Added
- Counselor dashboard KPIs: students, average completion, needs follow-up, upcoming exams, average improvement, not booked and inactive. Also the needs-follow-up list, upcoming exams and latest alerts.
- Counselor roster with every column from the brief and filters (class, booking, exam type, activity, completion, follow-up status, score, search), built by `StudentRosterService` with grouped queries.
- Tabbed student page: overview, scores, exams, activity, content, challenges (placeholder), notes and alerts.
- Manual follow-up status (audited), private-by-default counselor notes (shared notes appear on the student dashboard), and author-only note delete.
- Automatic alerts (`StudentAlertService`): not booked, upcoming exam with low activity, inactive, improvement, below target near the exam. Thresholds come from settings, alerts never duplicate and auto-resolve, and acknowledge and resolve are audited. Refreshed daily (`tamakkun:refresh-alerts`) and on exam changes.
- Pages: تحتاج متابعة, التنبيهات, الاختبارات القادمة, النتائج.
- `students.follow-up` permission (migration). Policies for notes and alerts.
